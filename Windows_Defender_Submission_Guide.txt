To prevent Windows Defender from flagging your application:

1. TEST ON MULTIPLE MACHINES FIRST
   - Run the executable on 3-4 different Windows machines
   - This helps build reputation with Microsoft

2. SUBMIT TO MICROSOFT (Recommended):
   - Go to: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/wdsi/filesubmission
   - Upload your executable
   - Select: "Developer - My software"
   - Reason: "Not malware / false positive"
   - Wait 24-48 hours for analysis

3. ORGANIZATIONAL WHITELISTING:
   For organizations, add to Windows Defender exclusions:
   - Windows Security -> Virus & threat protection
   -> Manage settings -> Add or remove exclusions
   -> Add folder exclusion for your app directory

4. DISTRIBUTION TIPS:
   - Include a digital signature if possible
   - Provide clear documentation
   - Use a professional installer
   - Include contact information
